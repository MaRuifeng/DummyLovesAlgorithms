# Dummy Loves Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description

This is a repository where I keep all interesting algorithms and data structures I came across either in work or learning. 

Lack of a well-trained background in computer science always pushed me back in taking time to catch up in algorithms and data structures. But that is indeed
the area where a programmer trains his brain and align with his beloved machine. 

## Requirements

Java 8 is required so as to support the functional interface and Lambda expressions used. 

## How

Each package contains an interesting algorithmic question with solution provided. 

* Run it as a Java application in a common IDE like Eclipse (make sure Java 8 is supported). This provides flexibility to modify code. 
* Key function calls will be provided with roughly estimated running time so as to cross check with the indicated time complexity.

## List of algorithmic questions
* [Find the largest sub-array sum of a given integer array](./src/maxSubsequenceSum/MaxSubseqSum.java)
* [Find the largest absolute difference of two non-overlapping sub-arrays of a given integer array](./src/maxSubsequenceDiff/MaxSubseqDiff.java)
* [Find total number of reverse pairs in a given integer array](./src/numOfReversePairs/NumOfReversePairs.java)
* [Find the largest sum of a sub-array with size K in a given integer array](./src/maxSubarraySumOfSizeK/MaxSubArraySumOfSizeK.java)
* [Find the k'th smallest item from a given array of distinct integers](./src/kthSmallestElementInArray/kthSmallestElementInArray.java)
* [Dynamic Programming](./src/dynamicProgramming)
  * [Fibonacci Numbers](./src/dynamicProgramming/FibNumbers.java)
  * [Coin change problems](./src/dynamicProgramming/CoinKeeper.java)
    * Number of possible combinations for given sum
    * List of possible combinations for given sum
    * Least number of coins needed for given sum
  * [Number arrangements to get a fixed sum](./src/dynamicProgramming/NumberOrganizer.java)
  * [Maximum sub-array sum](./src/maxSubsequenceSum/MaxSubseqSum.java)
  * [Ugly Numbers](./src/dynamicProgramming/UglyNumbers.java)
  * [Maximum stock profit](./src/dynamicProgramming/StockProfit.java)


## Background

This all started with a day when I accidentally picked a book my university professor passed me when I graduated. 

*Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in Java* by *Weiss, Mark Allen* (ISBN 0-201-35754-2). It's a textbook for first-year graduate student in computer 
science so it should be a good starting point.

A lot of examples in this repository will be from this book.
