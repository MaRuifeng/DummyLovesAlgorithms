# Dummy Loves Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description

This is a repository where I keep all interesting algorithms and data structures I came across either in work or learning. 

Lack of a well-trained background in computer science always pushed me back in taking time to catch up in algorithms and data structures. But that is indeed
the area where a programmer trains his brain and align with his beloved machine. 

## Requirements

Java 8 is required so as to support the functional interface and Lambda expressions used. 

## How

Each package contains an interesting algorithmic question with solution provided. 

* Run it as a Java application in a common IDE like Eclipse (make sure Java 8 is supported). This provides flexibility to modify code. 
* Key function calls will be provided with roughly estimated running time so as to cross check with the indicated time complexity.

## Background

This all started with a day when I accidentally picked a book my university professor passed me when I graduated. 

*Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in Java* by *Weiss, Mark Allen* (ISBN 0-201-35754-2). It's a textbook for first-year graduate student in computer 
science so it should be a good starting point.

A lot of examples in this repository will be from this book.
